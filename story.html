                <p> In October 2022, UNC Chapel Hill student Vinay Sudarsanam and Duke student Sathvika Gandavarapu met at the North Carolina State Fair in Raleigh.
                    A simple phone call resulted in an organization designed to provide UNC and Duke students with opportunities to mentor middle school students and help them find their passions.

                <p> Later that year, we learned that a child's future is determined in the first years of life. We developed an Evidence Based prenatal-3 yrs Early Childhood Home Visiting program for local families.
                    Since March 2023, Thrive Together has been a member of the Quarterly NC DHHS Home Visiting Consortium.

                <p> We also established Thrive Together's Community Support Initiative (CSI), enabling students to create change in communities.
                    With this Initiative, members work with local communities, identifying needs and collaborating with the community to address them.

                <p> After running into structural issues with implementing our home visiting program, we refocused the organization around the Community Support Initiative.
                    Our new Thrive Together community projects are designed to bridge the gaps between communities, solving issues and supporting adolescents.
